To write a service class use the command:

```shell
ng g service service/server
```

- `g` is short for generate.
- `service/` is the destination folder where this service file will be saved.
- `server` is the name of the service class.

This command will create the main file as well as the test file.

To mark an observable, write the variable name and append `$` sign at the end.

Example: `servers$`
